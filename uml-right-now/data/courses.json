The course reviews design concepts and the use of Assistive Technology as it relates to education, communication, vocation, recreation, and mobility for individuals with disabilities.  Laws focusing on assistive technology in the home, school, community, and the work place will be examined.  The course explores both 'low tech' and 'high tech' types of assistive technologies that are available to support people with disability, based on the ICF model of disability.  Interaction with users of assistive technology is accomplished through an experiential learning project.

Africa is portrayed and discussed as a locus of ancient tribal conflicts, disease, famine, and suffering.  While struggles do occur - just as they do in all places - understanding the diverse experiences of the peoples of Africa requires engagement with the cultures, politics, religions,  and perspectives of people in more than fifty countries across a vast continent.  While such engagement can hardly be accomplished in a semester, we will attempt to scratch at the surface in different ways that reveal ideas, experiences, and thoughts that reflect political life and culture in Africa south of the Sahara in a more reflective manner. Throughout this course, I challenge you to remember that politics as we usually conceive them - the policies, programs, and posturing of government and public organizations - are a backdrop to the way real people live their lives every day.  Policies and political systems are less important for the fact that they exist than for the ways in which they affect the lives of those they govern.  With this approach, I hope we will be able to pick apart government structures, political organizations, and policy issues in ways that will shed light on the construction and culture of African politics.  This requires a focus on  power - who has it, how they use it, and to what ends.","credits":"3","link":"https:\/\/www.uml.edu\/catalog\/courses\/POLI\/2150?courselist=%2Fcatalog%2Fadvance-search.aspx%3Fprefix%3DPOLI%26type%3Dprefix","pre-reqs":" no pre-requisite ","fall":true,"spring":true},{"code":"POLI.2180","name":"Introduction to Politics and Sports (Formerly 46.218)","description":"Analyzes the growing importance of sports in American life.

European political thought has deeply shaped American political values and institutions, but at the same time, America is not Europe. America is a young country, with a comparatively short history, that has been shaped by strange things; the \"empty\" freedom of the frontier, Indigenous occupants, unfathomable natural resources, intense religious fervor, and unprecedented human suffering. In short, America has its own distinctive tradition of political thought. In this course, we will explore the sources and threads of political thought in the American experience, drawing on both canonical political thinkers as well as popular and critical sources. We will begin with the Puritan colonial founding and continue through the present. This course highlights the relationship between learning the history of political theory in America and coming to our own contemporary political understandings.

Thus, communication patterns present critical issues for sociological inquiry. This course introduces communication as a central yet often ignored element of social life. It surveys existing communication theories, then focuses on models used by marginalized populations in efforts to democratize communication systems. Finally, it introduces tools for communication strategizing. As a final product students will conduct a frame analysis of a current social topic. From a general liberal arts perspective, the course will stress critical thinking and writing skills.","credits":"3","link":"https:\/\/www.uml.edu\/catalog\/courses\/SOCI\/3110?courselist=%2Fcatalog%2Fadvance-search.aspx%3Fprefix%3DSOCI%26type%3Dprefix","pre-reqs":" Pre-Req: SOCI.1010 Intro to Sociology.","fall":false,"spring":false},{"code":"SOCI.3160","name":"Youth and Society (Formerly 48.316)","description":"Youth (or adolescence) constitutes a historically and socially constructed stage of the life course between childhood and adulthood.
